    <h2>About Lucali</h2>

    <p>These days when you hear about NY pizza, it's difficult to not hear mention of Lucali's. It seems to be equivalent with what's considered to be solid NY pizza. You'll find it in the Carroll Gardens neighnorhood of Downtown Brooklyn not too far from the Barclay Center. Given its location in a busy area, it has a lively vibe to it. As for the pizza itself, it stands out because it's made in a brick oven. It's my favorite margherita pizza in Brooklyn. Expect a long wait time though.</p>
