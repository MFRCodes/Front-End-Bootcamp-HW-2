<!-- I wanted this section to show the qualities of each restaurant that I took into consideration when creating my rankings. I decided to use an unordered list rather than an ordered one so as to not have viewers think that the qualities listed are being ranked against each other. -->

    <p> Things Being Measured:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pizza
        </li>
        <li>
            Atmosphere or Vibe 
        </li>
        <li>
            Wait Time 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>First Up: DiFara</h2>

    <p>This pizza can be found in the quiet Brooklyn neighborhood known as Midwood. It's a popular spot due to its close proximity to several schools so you can expect to wait at least 20 minutes on its busiest days. And the quality of its pizza keeps the customers coming back for more. The pizza is filling but not heavy. </p>

<!-- I wanted the website and Instagram links to be arranged in rows hence why they are inside of the "tr" element.  -->

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Site</th>
            <th>Link</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Website</td>
            <td><a href="https://www.difarapizzany.com/">Check out their website</a></td>
            <tr>
                <td>Instagram</td>
                <td><a href="https://www.instagram.com/difaranyc/">Don't forget about their Instagram</a></td>
            </tr>

<!-- As for the form, I wanted viewers to be able to briefly give their opinion on my rankings and I thought the city they live in would give context to their opinions hence why I used them as placeholders. -->
