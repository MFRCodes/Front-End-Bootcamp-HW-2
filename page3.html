    <h2>About L&B Spumoni Gardens</h2>

    <p>The square or Sicilian slice from L&B Spumoni Gardens takes the number one spot. There are no words to describe how delicious this pizza is. Eating it, is a spiritual experience. No other pizza in NYC compares to it. You just have to try it our yourself. You'll find it on a quiet street in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn. It's not far from Coney Island Beach or the Luna Park amusement park. Spending the day at the beach and then ending the night with a couple of slices of the square pizza at L&B's makes for great summer nights in Brooklyn. Expect long wait times during busy seasons like summer.  </p>
